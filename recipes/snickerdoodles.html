    <h2>About this recipe</h2>
    <p>Snickerdoodles are soft, slightly tangy cookies coated in cinnamon-sugar. Because they're rolled and covered in cinnamon-sugar, snickerdoodles tend to have a cracked appearance when they're fully baked.</p><p>Nobody quite knows where the cookie got its name, but some speculate it comes from ​​"schneckennudel" (a cinnamon-spiked German dessert).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Sugar</b>: This snickerdoodle cookie recipe starts with 1 ½ cups of white sugar.</li>
        <li><b>Butter and shortening</b>: A blend of butter and shortening creates the ideal rich, fluffy, and soft texture.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs</b>: Two large eggs add moisture and richness. Plus, they help bind the dough together.</li>
        <li><b>Vanilla</b>: Vanilla extract lends complexity and enhances the overall flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Flour</b>: All-purpose flour has gluten, which gives the dough structure.</li>
        <li><b>Cream of tartar</b>: Most snickerdoodle recipes call for cream of tartar, an ingredient that gives the cookies their signature tangy flavor and pillowy texture.</li>
        <li><b>Baking soda</b>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
        <li><b>Salt</b>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><b>Cinnamon-sugar</b>: The snickerdoodles are rolled in a sweet, cozy mixture of cinnamon and sugar before they're baked.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Make the dough</b>: Beat the sugar, butter, shortening, eggs, and vanilla together. Mix the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, then stir until well-combined.</li>
        <li><b>Roll the dough</b>: Shape the dough into walnut-sized balls. Roll each ball in cinnamon-sugar until they're all evenly coated.</li>
        <li><b>Bake the cookies</b>: Bake the cookies in a preheated oven until they're set, but not too hard. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
