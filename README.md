This project is intended to help me practise HTML, by creating a 
basic recipe website.

In this project, I have demonstrated the following abilities:

    - Using different HTML tags to build a web page.
    - Using attributes to add links and show images.
    - Structuring my files correctly, such as the homepage, recipe pages and images.
    - Using git, when to commit, and how to write commit messages.
